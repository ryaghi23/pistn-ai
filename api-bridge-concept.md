# Operation CHARM - Hybrid Cloud Setup

## Concept: Local Database + Cloud Frontend

### Architecture:
```
Internet Users → Cloud Web App → Your Local API → Local Database
```

### Components:

1. **Local API Server** (your current setup)
   - Runs on your PC with database access
   - Exposed via secure tunnel
   - Handles all database queries

2. **Cloud Frontend** (lightweight)
   - Deployed on Vercel/Netlify (free)
   - Serves the web interface
   - Makes API calls to your local server

3. **Secure Tunnel**
   - Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok
   - Encrypts connection between cloud and local

### Benefits:
- ✅ Database stays on your fast local SSD
- ✅ Web interface served from CDN (fast globally)
- ✅ No need to upload 756GB to cloud
- ✅ Lower hosting costs
- ✅ You control the data

### Setup Steps:
1. Modify server.js to be API-only
2. Create separate frontend app
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify
4. Set up secure tunnel for API
